Summary: Deciding on what blogging platform to use.

I've been wanting to start writing more and I figured a blog would be a
sensible outlet for that. The problem is that it's very easy —
especially for me — to become distracted with the implementation, and
then lose focus on the writing itself.

The reason for choosing Blogger is mainly that I can use it on my own
domain for free (unlike paying for domain mapping with
[wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com/)). Yes, I could run
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) on my own server, but then I start
paying server costs for something that I might give up on in a few
months. It also gives me something else to maintain, particularly
important in the light of [recent
incidents](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/huge-attack-on-wordpress-sites-could-spawn-never-before-seen-super-botnet/).

Also, if I start considering running my own server, then there are even
more options. Maybe I should be using WordPress, but maybe I should be
using a custom [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) system instead?

Because of this, the conclusion I reached is that it's certainly worth
looking into the alternatives in the future, but, in the short term,
it's best to just start writing first.

What I think I'm trying to say is: **please excuse the mess**. I'll
certainly make an effort to make this look better in the future, rather
than just using a stock template.

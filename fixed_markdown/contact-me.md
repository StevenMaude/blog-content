Summary: How to contact me.

Oh, hi there!

I'm Steve and (rather obviously) this is my blog. Starting
in 2013, I was late to blogging but it's great to have the freedom to
write about whatever I like; this has probably been a big factor in me
posting fairly regularly.

Elsewhere, you can also find me occasionally
writing for my [current employer's
blog](https://blog.scraperwiki.com/author/stevenmaude/) where I'm
working as a data scientist. I've also made a guest post on [DJ
TechTools](http://www.djtechtools.com/2014/01/31/how-traktor-can-help-you-learn-to-beatmatch/)
(one of the biggest sites and communities for digital DJs).

Additionally, I've also written several specialised technical papers and
reviews relating to my previous work as a [research
scientist](http://dx.doi.org/10.2217/nnm.13.65). (This was before
finding an excuse to do more work with computers.)

Anyway, since you
clicked on this link, I'm guessing you might want to know how to get in
touch.

An easy way is via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/StevenMaude). If
you've got something more substantial than will fit into 140 character
posts, comments here on the relevant post are welcome. Alternatively,
you can email using the address below:

Even if you're not particularly into technology, you probably wouldn't
have escaped hearing about Heartbleed last month.

Without going into details here — the [site written by researchers who
disclosed the vulnerability](http://heartbleed.com/) has a detailed
technical summary, and [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/1354/) had a nice
non-technical summary — it affected servers using OpenSSL and meant that
it was possible for attackers to retrieve confidential information (for
example, passwords) or even [the private keys of
servers](http://blog.cloudflare.com/answering-the-critical-question-can-you-get-private-ssl-keys-using-heartbleed).

It's old news now; a month's passed since. What was striking about the
whole incident is that, despite the initial fuss in both the specialist
press and more general news sources, the communication of the status of
web services was conspicuous by its absence.

Out of the hundred or so sites that I have accounts on, just **one** of
them emailed me to reassure me that they weren't exposed to Heartbleed.
The only clear indication I saw while visiting a site was on Soundcloud,
who advised users to change passwords.

From some of the lists of popular sites that were being maintained at
the time, I know there was at least one site that I had an account on
that were at some point exposed to Heartbleed. Yet, as far as I can
tell, they didn't bother to inform their users that.

I'm not sure what their motivation was; an email or blog post/banner on
site would have been really helpful. Maybe owners of sites wanted to
avoid alarm, but I'd personally prefer a clear reassurance that
everything is OK with them.

It's unrealistic to expect that some widespread security issue won't
happen again. If something does happen though, I do hope that sites do a
better job in clarifying their position.

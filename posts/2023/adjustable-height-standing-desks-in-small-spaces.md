Summary: Notes on installing a Fully Jarvis desk in a small corner space.

## A new desk

I am standing up while typing this with my computer and keyboard resting
on a new desk. My previous desk — a cheap, but value for money, IKEA
effort — has been swapped for a Fully Jarvis adjustable height frame
with a custom desktop.

When I used to actually go into an office — way before remote working
was the done thing — there used to be rudimentary, but functional
standing desk setups, based on an IKEA hack of using a side table placed
on the standard office desks. I actually enjoyed using that when I was
in the office. The Fully Jarvis has height adjustment, so you can
switch between sitting and standing at the desk.

What I will not cover here are the pros and cons of standing versus
sitting. But when using a computer for a lot of the working day, even
not considering anything else, it seems a positive feature to be able to
change posture and not just be in the same working position for several
hours of the day.

### Limited space

One problem: I did not have too much space in the corner the desk is now
sat. This made it trickier to ascertain whether a Jarvis desk would work
at minimum size, and to get a suitable desktop. There was very little
useful guidance online about what would work here.

In this post, I will note some of the considerations I had, and what I
found from the process of buying and installing the frame and desktop in
a smaller space.

## Some notes on standing desks for small spaces

Like just about everything else, there are a lot of opinions on standing
desks out there. However, much like the limited range of desks that are
out there to fit a small space, there are relatively few opinions on
desks for small spaces.

### What's out there?

Many desks and separate desktops seem to start at 120 cm by 70 cm. 140
cm by 70 cm is another common size. Both of these were considerably
bigger than the existing desk I was using: 100 cm by 60 cm.

There were occasionally standing desks that I found at a more suitable
100 cm by 60 cm, but often they all looked like they were from the same
or similar suppliers: frequently having a ridge in the middle of the
desk. That didn't look great, and I thought it might be fairly
irritating if using the desk to rest on while writing.

So, given most desktops are too large, then the next step is to consider
getting a custom size cut. If you have the tools and the competence,
then you could do this yourself.

I have neither.

There is also the problem of getting a huge worktop home, which may well
need you to pay the delivery cost, unless you happen to have a large van
handy.

IKEA do offer custom sizes on some of their desktops, but these, from
memory, may work out actually more expensive for less material than the
fixed sizes they offer. The store I visited also had a lead time of
about a month too, which wasn't great. Fully have a fairly generous 30
day trial period, and I wanted to try out the frame in that time to be
sure it was right. A month's wait for a desktop would have probably
given insufficient time to actually build the desk up.

I also looked at local timber merchants but these were fairly expensive.

In the end, I read a suggestion from someone who said they had used a
Kabsa kitchen worktop from [B&Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%26Q) —
a fairly common building materials supplier in the UK, and mentioned
that B&Q cut the worktop to size, free of charge. I had also read that
someone had used a kitchen worktop with a Jarvis frame and they said it
was fine.

### Buying from B&Q

Before you start thinking, "are you doing paid promotions for niche UK
retailers now?", *certainly not*. I had quite a few problems in actually
getting hold of a worktop and getting it cut. In the end, I did managed
to get a laminate worktop.

There are a few things to watch out for with B&Q:

* Check the store has a timber cutting service: not all do.
* The laminate worktops have a variety of surfaces. Some are smoother,
  while some have a rougher grain feeling to them. There are samples in
  store that you can check first.
* The worktops, at least in the store I visited, were simply only in
  thick plastic film, without any decent protection. Yes, this meant you
  could easily see the worktops, but also meant that almost half of the
  worktops of the kind I wanted were already damaged.
* B&Q sell edging tape that closely matches many of the worktops, but
  perhaps it is best to check that they have it in stock before
  committing to a worktop purchase.
* There is a limit to the number of free cuts B&Q offer, but for a
  worktop, you probably don't need more than one or two cuts.

On the positive side, and, no, this is still not a paid promotion, the
staff cutting the worktop to size were helpful, and let me measure the
cut size to ensure it was correct before paying.

Finally here, I should add that one practical advantage of having a
smaller worktop cut was that it also made it easier to fit in a car.

### Desktop fit on the Jarvis frame

The Jarvis frame assembly is relatively simple, marred by the paper
instructions being a little bit vague and the official assembly video
being a little bit too brief, and not covering custom desktops. The
bundled paper instructions did not cover custom desktops either. There
was a [supplement on the Fully
website](https://static.fully.com/image/upload/v1637081801/fully-website/product/jarvis-desk/AI/EU/fully-jarvis-wide-using-your-own-desktop-EU-d03.pdf),
but this is not especially obvious. I am not sure why Fully could not
provide the extra few pages of instructions in the standard assembly
guide.

There was one [YouTube
guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NFmOZphHPM) that was
particularly useful on assembling the frame with a custom desktop. It's
definitely worth watching through once, and then unpacking the Jarvis
boxes and then starting to figure out what you need to do.

The trickiest part was measuring the holes for the desktop screws. When
placing the frame upside down on the underside of the desktop and
holding it together, you will find that the frame tends to move around a
little (which, *obviously* it does, because nothing is screwed together
yet). This makes it more difficult to mark the holes. I ended up
measuring and re-checking the proposed hole positions several times.

From memory, I think that the holes did not need drilling first. The
screws just went straight into the worktop with an electric screwdriver.

A couple of questions that I had during assembly, that luckily had the
right answer:

* Do Fully provide screws for custom worktops? *Yes.*
* Would the worktop I bought be the correct thickness for the frame and
  the screws? *Yes.*

After the desk was assembled, the edges were covered with the matching
edging tape that I had bought. The edges were stuck to the desktop with
EVO-STIK Impact Contact Adhesive from a tin: that seemed to be a common
recommendation for people working on finishing kitchen worktop
installations.

In the end, after doubly checking everything was screwed together and
turning the frame over, everything seemed to be fine. Which was a
considerable relief considering the cost of the frame.

#### Desktop specifications

##### Jarvis frame

* I chose the 3-stage frame, for the extra variation in height
  adjustment, particularly for sitting.
* The frame I have is the alloy colour, which actually looks a lighter
  silver than the duller, colder looking image shown on the Fully site
  when ordering.
* I also paid the extra for the programmable memory control panel
  upgrade. It is well worth it, as it does not add much to the cost, but
  makes adjusting the desk much quicker.

##### Worktop

* B&Q's kitchen worktops are typically around 62 cm deep, which is not
  exactly a standard desk size. But, it is roughly the standard size for
  kitchen worktops in the UK. That is a few centimetres shorter than
  Fully's minimum recommended 69 cm for the Jarvis frame. But, when
  assembled, the table feet do not particularly stick out, and the frame
  does not seem less stable for the smaller desktop.
* I went for a very slightly wider desktop (112 cm) than the minimum
  suggested by Fully (108 cm). You could probably go all the way to the
  minimum, but I think having a little extra space from the frame to the
  desktop edge was worth it.
* As mentioned, a moderately thick desktop (38 mm) works fine, and has a
  nice weight to it.

## What do I think?

Overall, I am pretty happy with the result, given that the top is a
custom build. Someone who did not know that it was a kitchen worktop
could easily mistake it for the desktop that is sold with the frame.

The frame is also fairly sturdy, even when at standing height, which was
my other concern, and one you cannot easily address without just
building the desk in your own space and trying it.

That positive impression is tempered very slightly by the sheer cost of
the frame: the best part of £500. And then tempered back to positive
again when I remember that I have not paid for the frame at all. No,
this is not a paid promotion for Fully either. I was fortunate enough to
get one of my [employers](https://sensiblecode.io) to cover it in their
homeworking equipment budget. Thanks also to [my colleague
Mike](https://github.com/mikejamesthompson) at Sensible Code, who
recommended the frame when I asked about it.

The other benefit of buying Fully over some other brands is that the
company has been around a while, and that they have some positive
feedback for their customer service. I interacted with them briefly and
they were very helpful. There are other, considerably cheaper brands of
adjustable height standing desks, but some of these appeared to have
mixed reviews with the suggestion that support were non-existent when
the desks failed.

Finally, Fully do seem to have fairly regular discounts. If you are not
buying in a hurry, it's worth watching the price and holding out.

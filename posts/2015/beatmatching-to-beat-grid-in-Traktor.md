Summary: Beatmatching by ear can help you beat grid music in Traktor.

## Tracks that beat Traktor's beat detection

Traktor's not always perfect in automatic beat detection. I was trying to set
the correct beats per minute (bpm) value for a particular track and not having
a lot of luck with the tap function that Traktor provides. The estimated bpm
kept jumping around on each click.

If you're not familiar, a tap feature is common in music software for beat
detection: tap a button along to the beat of the music, and after a few clicks,
you should have a fairly good estimation of what the bpm is.

Another option you have is to manually adjust the beat grid to set the bpm; the
beat grid is a series of line markers that you want to mark the track's beats.
It acts as a visual guide for the user that shows whether the bpm is set
correctly.

This is a chore as it requires fine adjustment. You'll end up clicking a lot to 
stretch or compress the grid and correct it. Also, if you're zoomed in to precisely
align this, you can't see if everything's still OK further along the track
without going back and forth, like Cameo.

## Beatmatching to find the bpm

The last time I was contemplating doing this I realised that if you can
beatmatch by ear, then to find an unknown track's bpm, you can simply beatmatch
to a track with a known good bpm. It's more fun too as you're actually
*listening* to the music and DJing, rather than *click-click-clicking* like
you're gold farming in some video game.

Once you're happy that the tracks are beatmatched, if you have the current bpm
for the known good track displayed — you can change what's displayed in each
deck's heading in Preferences — then that should give you the correct bpm for
the track with unknown bpm. You can then type this in where the bpm is
displayed on the "Grid" panel for the deck playing the track.

All that's left to do is seek to the first downbeat and add that as a beat grid
cue point (use the "Cue" panel for the deck) and the track should be ready for
beatmatching. Traktor usually does a decent job on finding that downbeat
though.

That would be all, except you might only have a correct bpm for the particular
section you've been listening to: it's possible that the bpm fluctuates. If the
beat detection fails, this is quite a common problem, particularly for older
pieces of music which weren't created digitally and may drift slightly due to
human timing. A fix for this is to just work with a loop in the track which
does have a sufficiently steady bpm to mix. You can add loops in the "Cue"
panel.

While I'm here, I should wistfully wish that Native Instruments would improve
the beat matching aspect. Using multiple beat markers, Ableton's capable of
adjusting — "warping" they call it — the track to fix it such that it has a
consistent tempo, something that Traktor lacks. So, I'm still saving for
Ableton.

## G300 to Moto G

My G300 has been getting tired. It's a little irritating that I know
it's inherently defective. There's a [flash memory
issue](http://www.modaco.com/topic/366014-a-warning-to-all-g300-owners-please-read-hynix-flash-memory-problem/)
which has resulted in dead phones if they had the wrong type of flash
memory (which mine unfortunately has). I'm a little muddled from my
reading, so I don't know if this death sentence is caused by, or just
exacerbated by the use of custom ROMs. Anyway, the safest thing to do
was to stick with an older CyanogenMod version. It's annoying that I was
stuck on old Android and the phone's slowness has started to frustrate
me, leading me to decide to get a new one.

I did consider a Nexus 5, but heard bad things about battery life which
put me off; I thought I'd get frustrated with paying quite a lot
(although [they were on offer for
£240](http://www.hotukdeals.com/deals/google-nexus-5-carphone-warehouse-sim-free-any-colour-free-delivery-240-cpw-1833808)
recently) and still not being quite satisfied.

Instead, *the* value for money budget smartphone at the moment
[seems](http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/moto-g-1199218/review)
to [be](http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/moto/g/) the [Moto
G](http://www.motorola.com/us/shop-all-mobile-phones-1/Moto-G/moto-g-pdp.html),
so I picked one up for a penny under £100.

From first glance, it seems a great deal for what you get: nice 720p
screen, front facing camera, quad core CPU; all a sizable upgrade over
my G300 (which was around the same price about eighteen months ago). I
haven't had much chance to use it yet. Initially, I was having issues
rooting the phone with Motorola's server not recognising the phone's
unlock data. A couple of days later all went fine, but I've only just
got time to start setting it up again.

## PDroid to XPrivacy

By setting it up, I mean the necessary business of moving existing data
across from my old phone, as well as making sure my phone's rooted and
running an ad-blocker and something to control app permissions for
accessing my data.

I'm a big fan of PDroid on my current phone to restrict app permissions.
Especially so these days with so many apps wanting unnecessary
permissions. I don't even install that many third-party apps, but I find
it incredibly invasive when apps that don't have any reasonable reason
to, say, know your location want to find where you are.

Since I last installed a custom ROM, I found that
[Auto-Patcher]({filename}../2013/patching-android-roms-for-pdroid-using.md)
has been deprecated and [XPrivacy](https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy)
seems to be the permission control app of choice for Android now. You
still need root permissions to use it, though it doesn't require ROM
patching, which means you can use it with a stock, rooted ROM, and
install it directly from Play Store.

There's a CyanogenMod port for Moto G, but it's only nightly at the
moment, so I think I'll try and see how I get on with stock for now.

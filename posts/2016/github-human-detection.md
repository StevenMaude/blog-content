Summary: GitHub hiding my profile reminds me there are no guarantees of your presence on online services.

<blockquote>
  <p>Human, human, human, human,<br>
     Human, human, human, human,<br>
     Human, human, human, human,<br>
     Human, human, human after all.
  </p>

I logged into GitHub this week and saw an unusual message:

<img class="article-image" src="{static}/images/2016/GitHub_not_human.png" alt="The GitHub message prompting me that I'm possibly not human.">

> One of our mostly harmless robots seems to think you are not a human.
>
> Because of that, it's hidden your profile from the public. If you really are
human, please contact support to have your profile reinstated. We promise we
won't require DNA proof of your humanity.

Putting aside the irony of GitHub detecting bots with their own
automated systems, one short email later, it was politely resolved in
ten minutes by GitHub's support team, who decided I was human after
all.[^1]

## What might have caused it?

Perhaps creating several similar looking repositories (albeit with different
code) in a relatively short space of time. These contain example code to access
[the API](https://github.com/pdftables) that we offer at work. Maybe it's
because the commits looked similar, maybe because the commit messages or the
commit content contained a URL. Who can say?

## Why is this not ideal?

Despite the quick resolution, the way this situation is handled might be
flawed.

First, though the warning was omnipresent, large and red, it didn't describe
the full nature of the problem. The phrase "hidden your profile from the
public" to me just implied that GitHub had hidden my profile page.

Seemingly, I could still do and access everything as normal, albeit with a
warning on every page, so I didn't fully appreciate the consequences.

From reading around, what apparently happens is that **any repository
that's under your profile becomes a nice 404 error** to anyone who's not
you. I didn't check this firsthand (because I wasn't under any
impression that anything had really changed with my account).  If this
is true, that might create some issues which I'll discuss later in this
post.[^2]

Second, they didn't send me any email warning at all, unless it went into my
junk mail. I only noticed because I logged into my account and there was a big
red banner at the top of every screen. What if I didn't log into GitHub at all
for a while?

Finally, I assume that the process happens instantly when their system
considers you a bot. There's no grace period where you can confirm your
identity, before they hide your profile publically. It just gets hidden
and, what I suspect happens is, the first you know of it is when it has
been hidden.

## How might this cause problems?

Let's say that you have a very high profile project under your GitHub account
that lots of people rely on. Let's also suppose that this is the definitive
installation source.

At least for Go projects, this may be true: Go developers will often host
projects on GitHub and that's the official source. Now, for whatever reason,
your account gets labelled as a bot, and perhaps all of a sudden, *your*
software is unavailable to anyone else, potentially breaking *their* software.
If this was a major problem, I'd imagine this would get fixed pretty promptly,
but still, it would be an inconvenience, and a baffling one for anyone
encountering it.

Again, I'm prepared to be corrected on this. If this isn't how things
work, that's great. Maybe popular accounts, e.g. those with lots of
followers, or owning projects with lots of stars, have some protection
against this before their accounts are tagged in this way?

If there is a possibility that this could actually happen though, then
if there was some kind of short delay and an email warning before
labelling your account as "not human", at least you'd have a chance to
fix up your account first, without your account temporarily becoming a
Ghost of GitHub Past.

## What's the relevance to other online services?

This kind of situation isn't restricted specifically to GitHub. It does
illustrate features of online services that are ever present, but remain
latent until you encounter them. These are likely some variant of:

* the site owners can modify your account's privileges, disable your
  account, or even delete your account and all its content without
  warning.

* this might happen without any way of you appealing the decision;
  that's entirely down to the policies of the site.

* even if you behave in line with the site's terms and conditions, you
  may inadvertently break "rules" that the site owners don't even
  realise they have in place, but are instead derived by some automated
  machine learning system. In very much the same way that you might have
  experienced: has your bank ever suddenly prevented you from making a
  payment until you confirm the transaction? All of a sudden, you find
  yourself in the midst of some real life version of
  [Mao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_(card_game)) where you lose
  out because you don't even know what you did wrong.

## More on GitHub 

OK, diversion aside, let's go back to speculating about GitHub accounts.
Let's go further than hiding my account for a short time. What if my
GitHub account was disabled entirely either for some period of time, or
even deleted permanently?

A considerable amount of my work is done via GitHub. Using an
alternative would be a major inconvenience. With my employer, I'd have
to figure out some solution to resolving it, enabling me to contribute
again. That might mean moving to a competitor, or some self-hosted
solution, or that I submit patches instead. But who'd want to deal with
the overhead of working with patches from one developer when everyone
else is capable of just pushing straight to GitHub?

Even if you're just coding in your free time, this is also a problem if
you want to assist with any of the numerous open source projects that
take contributions directly via GitHub.

Another side issue if you're not rigorous with backups, you won't have
access to the repositories that you didn't have locally. However, GitHub
do state in their terms that they will attempt to "make a reasonable
effort to provide the affected account owner with a copy of their
account contents upon request".

GitHub's terms do state you can only have one account. It's less clear
whether having an account disabled precludes you from signing up again.
Nonetheless, they do say that they can "refuse any and all current or
future use of the Service, or any other GitHub service, for any reason
at any time". So it may be that any future accounts you create may well
be subject to being disabled due to your prior history.

The major online services are ubiquitous and have transformed the way
many people worldwide interact and work. It's worth remembering that
your continued ability to access them is never guaranteed. If you lose
access to services you use for leisure, it may well be frustrating. If
you're relying on them for work, you may find yourself dealing with big
problems that you very quickly need to solve.

With GitHub, I'm still not sure what my solution would be for work if
GitHub permanently kicked me out from their site. As much as GitHub,
historically at least, do seem to be on the side of developers, and I've
very few complaints about the site,[^3] it's still slightly concerning
that this gives them a position of power.

[^1]: Incidentally, it's weird thinking that it's more than possible
  that to some listeners these days, Daft Punk may well only be known as
  "that robot band that did some songs with Pharrell", despite having
  been around for more than twenty years.
  
    If, for whatever reason, you haven't heard the [Human After
    All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXYeARRyDWk&list=PLSdoVPM5Wnne47ib65gVG206M7qp43us-)
    album, I'd go straight to [Alive
    2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVKbF8khsrI&list=PLSdoVPM5WnndV_AXWGXpzUsIw6fN1RQVN)
    where those tracks work a lot better in context, rather than the
    isolation of individually being played out; they're closer to the
    realm of DJ tools that work magnificently live.

[^2]: Some other thoughts: I have no idea what happens to open pull
  requests, are they still visible? Can you create new pull requests?
  What happens to organisations where you're the sole member? What
  happens to GitHub pages under your profile? Again, no idea.

[^3]: Out of the main competitors, I've used Bitbucket considerably, and
  prefer GitHub, although Bitbucket is better in that personal private
  repositories don't require you to pay. The little use I've had of
  GitLab I've found very confusing. (Admittedly, that confusion may not
  have been helped by not being in charge of the GitLab group I was
  contributing to, so it was awkward trying to get permissions
  configured.)

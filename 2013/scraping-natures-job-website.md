Summary: Description of, and reasons for creating, my Nature job website scraper.
Alias: /2013/07/scraping-natures-job-website.html

Around six months ago, [I wrote a Python
script](https://github.com/StevenMaude/naturejobs_scraper) to scrape
[Nature's job website](http://www.naturejobs.com/). I haven't been using
it much lately, but I tested it today and found it had broken. After an
hour or so spent on it this afternoon, it's working again.

I found it pretty useful when I was searching for science jobs earlier
this year. It's a lot easier to skim through a single HTML table than to
click through tens of pages with twenty jobs on each page.

(You can also include keywords for location, employer or job title to
filter out. I was working from the principle of not really knowing what
kind of job I was looking for, so wanted to see most jobs, but knew that
I didn't want, for example, all the positions for PhD training listed.

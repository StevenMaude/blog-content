Summary: A comparison of the differences between working in university research and working in a technology startup.

In August this year, my academic postdoc contract ended and I moved on
to working at a [data science tech startup](https://scraperwiki.com/)
for a two month internship.

In fact, I was offered a short-term contract to extend my stay until
late autumn, and I was pleased to have that opportunity. By the time
that I actually leave at the end of this month, I'll have been there for
over four months. I figured now would be a good time to reflect a little
on what I've found, to structure my own thoughts and share them with
anyone interested in making a similar career change.

It's been an enjoyable and interesting move. It's been unusual to spend
the entire working day doing things which I'd previously worked on only
in my free time. The weeks have gone by really quickly, but it's been a
useful experience: I've learnt a lot and, importantly, I've more of an
idea of what I should continue to learn more about after I leave.

So, here are some remarks on my current working environment with some
comparisons to my previous academic work.

1. Common to many startups, the company I'm based at is relatively
small. That in itself is not that different from my past academic
experience[^1]. On the other hand, a huge distinction is that **most of
the people involved with the company are usually in the same office.**
Even if not physically present, they are usually on
[IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)/Hangouts. What
this means is that things seem to get resolved and decisions get made
far more quickly.

    This is a real plus for me, since both working in this company and in a
    tech job are completely new. If there's something I need help with or if
    I want to ask about some technical details of the company's platform,
    OBit's likely there's someone in the room who can give me good advice.

    It was rarely the case that everyone I'd interact with in university
    (supervisors, collaborators) would be in direct earshot, and I might
    only see these people occasionally, maybe once a week or month. If some
    problem came up, I'd probably end up sending an email and the time to
    get a reply might be a few minutes, but might take a lot longer.

    Having near-instant feedback is helpful in keeping you focused on the
    main problem at hand, rather than getting too distracted by the [yak
    shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving) that might be
    necessary along the way to solving it.

2. **Because the company's small, you get a feel of what's going on
throughout the entire company, from product development to customer
demands.** It's also an informal, open environment where discussion
doesn't seem to be stifled and which helps communicate this
information.

    We have daily [stand-up
    meetings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting). Everyone
    stands up and, in turn, describes what they achieved in the last working
    day, what they have planned for the day ahead and mention anything
    that's currently hindering them from making progress.

    This is something I really like. It lets you keep up with what everyone
    else is working on. It means you have to spend a minute or two deciding
    what you need to achieve in the day ahead (and sets this as a public
    commitment to yourself). And, importantly, it allows people find others
    who may be able to help them.

    We also hold retrospectives where the previous fortnight's work is
    reviewed and we look at what needs to be focused on in the next
    fortnight. There's then a vote on which issue particularly needs to be
    dealt with. Everyone's opinion — yes, even that of temporary employees
    and interns — is counted equally here.

    Working in university, I'd have a vague idea of the goals my colleagues
    were attempting to head towards, but, in my experience, group meetings
    and discussions were relatively rare. I would have a rough idea of the
    goals people were working towards, but not particularly aware of what
    they were working on day-to-day. Someone might be struggling with some
    problem or some experiment, but might not be aware that someone else may
    already have independently resolved that issue.

3. As the company produces a lot of code, **another way in which you can
see what others are doing is looking at the company's software
repositories**. We work using [GitHub](https://github.com/) and
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)[^2]. If you discover a problem or bug
with software that someone else has developed, you can either create a
fix yourself and submit a pull request, or raise an issue.

    Having data on shared drives is not uncommon for academics, but that can
    often just be in the form of individual backups, and may not be well
    organised for others to find that information. I certainly wouldn't have
    been likely to notice issues with someone's else work unless they came
    to me directly asking for help with some problem.

4. **Working with people remotely** via Google Hangouts **was a little odd
the first couple of times, but soon felt quite natural.** This works
well when coding. You can share screens with [one person driving and one
navigating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming), or you can
use [tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux) or similar to allow both
working partners to use the same terminal at once. I've only worked like
this a few times, but it felt little different from working side-by-side
in the same room.

    This also works well to remove the sense of isolation that remote
    workers can experience. It feels more like you're in an extension of the
    office. The few times when I'd been writing papers or my PhD thesis up
    at home, apart from getting the occasional email, I felt considerably
    more cut off.

5. Finally, **projects are often smaller and deadlines can be tighter**
than in the academic world. Justifiably, customers want a product or
service they are paying for delivered as quickly as possible. A
startup's funding may also be quite limited; there's pressure to move
quickly to generate income and/or gain further investment.

    From my experience in academic circles, deadlines can be more
    relaxed[^3]. Sometimes you may encounter deadlines for publications or
    conference abstract submissions, but these may not [exactly be
    strict](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=998).
    Projects also last for a much longer time; PhD students in the UK
    usually take three or four years tackling a research problem, largely
    individually.

For another opinion on moving from scientific research to working in
tech, I definitely recommend [this
post](http://womeninastronomy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/astroVdatascience.html)
from Jessica Kirkpatrick, who switched from astrophysics research to
working in data science. Jessica nicely summarises the wider issues
regarding careers, rather than the day-to-day working differences I've
focused on here.

[^1]: I realise that academic research varies hugely and, naturally, I can
only compare to my own experience. For what it's worth, I've worked in
two different research groups in two universities. In both cases, these
were not that large; most recently, the group I was a member of had
another postdoc, three to four PhD students, and usually a Masters
student.
[^2]: I find Bitbucket's web interface clunkier than GitHub and [it's
nowhere near as popular as GitHub for open source
projects](http://www.infoworld.com/print/227061), but it has better
pricing for private repositories provided you're working in a small
team.
[^3]: This is likely research supervisor dependent, however. My research
time was largely an easygoing one.

A couple of days ago, I read this O'Reilly report, [Analyzing the
Analyzers](http://oreilly.com/data/stratareports/analyzing-the-analyzers.csp),
by [Harlan Harris](https://twitter.com/HarlanH) and co-authors with a
lot of interest. It's a quick and pleasant read, and definitely worth
looking at.  
  
Considering the many news articles I see mentioning big data, the
authors make a sobering observation on this subject (p16-17):  
  
"*Most data scientists rarely work with terabyte or larger data... True
big data work seems limited to a relative small subset of data
scientists.*"  
  
Since it was a self-selecting survey, there is the possibility of bias
to consider, but the drop off when comparing the percentage of
respondents regularly working with terabyte data sets compared to
gigabyte data sets is staggering. The survey was also completed around a
year ago, so there is always the possibility that trends have changed
since then, especially in the fast moving tech world.  
  
What the report highlighted for me was the diversity of skills that come
under the umbrella of data scientist. They classified data scientists as
having one of five specialisms: business, machine learning/big data,
maths/operational research, programming, and statistics; all very
different career paths.

Related to this, I recently read a couple of posts on [Ryan
Swanstrom](https://twitter.com/swgoof)'s Data Science 101 blog (worth a
look; there are some useful links there) stating that "[data science is
more than just
statistics](http://datascience101.wordpress.com/2013/07/02/data-science-is-more-than-just-statistics-part-2/)".
He concludes that taking a data science course is a better decision than
taking statistics if you want to forge a data science career.  
  
Ryan distinguishes the two paths in terms of how they handle data. Data
scientists consider existing data and find ways to do something with it,
whereas statisticians may be involved in well-designed experiments from
the outset.  
  
Although that's quite a nice distinction, I think there's a little more
to it than that. A statistician may not know much about extracting data
from different information sources, storing it and accessing it. On the
other hand, a data scientist may be adept at these skills, but might not
have the same depth of statistical knowledge.  
  
I certainly think that the topics covered in a data science course are
going to be fairly widely applicable to several kinds of tech jobs, and
will probably give a good grounding in several disciplines. One issue is
that these courses are only just launching, so it will be a while before
anyone can really see how effective they are in getting employment and
on long-term career prospects compared with studying subjects such as
statistics or computer science directly.  
  
Of course, even if you specialise, it is always possible to acquire some
of the other necessary skills outside of the classroom. If you're
training to be a statistician, there's nothing to stop you learning
programming in your own time, or using tools like
[R](http://www.r-project.org/) or [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
for your work.  
  
Looking at the above report, the authors emphasise the need for a broad
knowledge base (p19), which might imply that a more general data science
course is a great idea. However, their very next point is that their
opinion is that a strong specialism — "*be it statistics, big data, or
business communication*" — makes for the best data scientists.  
  
Data science is more than just statistics, but it may not be that being
a specialist in some field is disadvantageous either (particularly if
most of your peers have data science qualifications and you have
something unique to offer).

In my case, after spending so long in education already, it would be
difficult for me to justify taking more time out from employment to take
one of the several data science courses that are springing up in the UK.
So, for me, a final encouraging finding of this report is that one of
the main routes to a data science career is from academic scientific
research, and fits with [DJ Patil's view from several years
ago](http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/06/what-is-data-science.html) that
"*the best data scientists tend to be 'hard scientists'*".

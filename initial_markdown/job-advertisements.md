As my current work contract ends in a couple of months, I'm frantically
looking for work which, of course, means reading many job postings.
(Incidentally, I wrote a [Python
script](https://github.com/StevenMaude/naturejobs_scraper/) earlier this
year to help expedite my job hunting.)

Usually, job specifications are pretty much just as you would expect
from the job title. I'm not entirely sure whether the highlighted point
in this vacancy was really necessary though:

"So, you're a maths expert. That's great for this role! Oh, one final
thing, if we happen to have a cake day at the office, are you going to
be able to ensure that everyone gets an equal share?"

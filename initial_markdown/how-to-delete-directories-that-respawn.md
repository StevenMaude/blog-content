I'd migrated a huge collection of files from a backup of a dusty old XP
install to a shiny new Windows 7 install. I'd copied everything across
to Win7 and then was deleting any unneeded files there.In a couple of
cases, once I'd tidied directories out, I found that I couldn't delete
them from within Windows Explorer. Well, I could delete them momentarily
before they instantly reappeared.It wasn't quite the same problem as the
one described
[here](http://serverfault.com/questions/429330/deleting-an-undeletable-directory-in-windows-7)
— I didn't receive any error message on deletion for one thing — but the
solution was the same: **open a command prompt and use the rmdir
command** to prevent the pesky thing returning again once and for all.

Summary: Fixing a common charging issue of the Logitech MX Revolution where the battery red LED flashes when charging.

...this one is great. Normally I'm just relieved I've got something
finally working and file the problem under 'done'.

Anyway, I've had a Logitech MX Revolution mouse[^1] for several years and
recently spotted that it wasn't charging. It has a series of battery
LEDs on the mouse which should normally flash green when charging. It
seems to be a common problem where this just flashes red.

The cause appears to be some kind of battery contact issue: [just
slamming the underside of the mouse down against
something](http://alexking.org/blog/2008/01/29/mx-revolution-flashing-red-light-in-cradle)
seems to be the advice that many users have taken to resolve it. In my
case, it took a couple of tries to do this — and I'd recommend doing
slamming it against something soft — but it worked.

[^1]: It's a fantastic mouse though unfortunately no longer manufactured,
having been replaced by [an inferior
model](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/performance-mouse-mx). Why
has the second wheel been replaced by buttons? [Why do you have to press
a button to toggle the scroll wheel from normal ratcheting scrolling to
free wheel
mode](http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Mice-and-Pointing-Devices/Performance-Mouse-MX-how-to-change-scroll-wheel-settings-and/td-p/451972?nobounce), rather than it elegantly autoswitching when you spin the wheel fast
enough? Who knows.

Hello! I'm Steve and, rather obviously, this is my blog.

Professionally, I spent my early career studying science and working in
scientific research. I trained as a chemist, generalised to study
nanoscale science, and continued to hedge my bets by completing a PhD
studying the physical chemistry of bio-inspired materials.

Later, spotting the increasing number of exciting opportunities to work
in software solving data problems, I switched careers to computing.
That turned out to be a good decision!

I've worked for [The Sensible Code Company](https://sensiblecode.io) for
several years and, for the last few, entirely remotely. As of 2021, I'm
still helping at Sensible Code part-time. The other part of my working
week is spent as a software developer at
[The Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science](https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk)
at the University of Oxford. This was an unexpected move. But I'm happy to
have gone full circle back to university to help others use data in their
health research.

This blog contains a lot of what I've published publicly, but I've also
got work elsewhere too. Here's a list of where you can find more of my
work and writing.

## Open source contributions

See my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/StevenMaude). I have a few of
my own projects and have contributed to other open source projects.

## Technology blogs

### The Sensible Code Company blog

[This post](https://medium.com/@SensibleCode/go-cantabular-f117a98adf02)
is one I wrote on why the company's using Go to develop their current
main product, [Cantabular](https://cantabular.com/). Cantabular is a
statistical publication tool with privacy features; the UK's Office
for National Statistics is intending to use it for publishing Census 2021
data.

### ScraperWiki blog

The Sensible Code Company used to be ScraperWiki before they rebranded
in 2016. I wrote several posts for [ScraperWiki's
blog](https://scraperwiki.com/author/stevenmaude/).

### DJ TechTools

At DJ TechTools, a major site and community for DJs, I wrote a number of
[posts](https://djtechtools.com/author/stevenmaude/) as a freelance
contributor.

## Technology articles

I was a co-author of the following:

* ["A Simple API to the
  KnowledgeStore"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2878379.2878381)
  (International Semantic Web Conference Developers Workshop conference
  proceedings paper, 2014)

## Scientific work

### PhD thesis

["Design and characterisation of functionalised self-assembled peptide
nanostructures"](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.555840)

### Scientific articles

I've been a co-author of several peer-reviewed scientific articles; for
several of these, I was first author.

* ["Peptide strand length controls the energetics of self‐assembly and
  morphology of β‐sheet fibrils"](https://doi.org/10.1002/bip.23073)
  (Peptide Science, 2018)
* ["Biomimetic self-assembling peptides as scaffolds for soft tissue engineering](https://doi.org/10.2217/nnm.13.65) (Nanomedicine, 2013, first author)
* ["*De novo* designed positively charged tape-forming peptides:
  self-assembly and gelation in physiological solutions and their
  evaluation as 3D matrices for cell
  growth"](https://doi.org/10.1039/C0SM00974A) (Soft Matter, 2011, first author)
* ["Peptide Synthesis and
  Self-Assembly"](https://doi.org/10.1007/128_2011_234)
  (Chapter in Peptide-Based Materials, part of the Topics in Current Chemistry book series, 2011, first author)
* ["Interaction of Self-Assembling β-Sheet Peptides with Phospholipid
  Monolayers: The Role of Aggregation State, Polarity, Charge and
  Applied Field"](https://doi.org/10.1021/la803368r) (Langmuir, 2009)

## Presentations

I've given talks on scientific research, career changes and technology.

List to be added!

Oh, hi there!

I'm Steve and (rather obviously) this is my blog.

Starting in 2013, I was late to blogging but it's great to have the
freedom to write about whatever I like; this has probably been a big
factor in me posting fairly regularly.

Elsewhere, you can also find me occasionally writing for my [current
employer's blog](https://blog.scraperwiki.com/author/stevenmaude/)
where I'm working as a data scientist. I've also made
[guest posts](http://djtechtools.com/author/stevenmaude/)
for DJ TechTools (one of the biggest sites and communities for
digital DJs).

Additionally, I've also written several specialised technical papers and
reviews relating to my previous work as a [research
scientist](http://dx.doi.org/10.2217/nnm.13.65). (This was
before finding an excuse to do more work with computers.)

Anyway, since you clicked on this link, I'm guessing you might want to
know how to get in touch; you can email using the address below:
